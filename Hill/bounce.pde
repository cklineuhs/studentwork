//Create a program that has a ball move around the screen and bounce off the edges.â€‹

//Part A:  Setup
//Draw a stationary ball in the exact center of the screen over a backdrop of any color.
//At the top of your program
//Create three variables:  
//float xPos    // the x position of the ball
//float yPos    // the y position of the ball
//int ballSize      // the size of the ball
//In setup()
//Set the size of the window
//Give xPos and yPos starting values
//Hint:  Use the variables width and height
//In draw()
//Set the background color
//Set the fill color for the ball
//Draw an ellipse at xPos, yPos that is ballSize large.
//Think:
//We put some things at the top, some things in setup, and some in draw.  Why?
//Why don't we just set the ellipse's position directly?  Why use a variable?

/*
So far so good!
I assume you haven't finished your acceleration, but otherwise it looks good.
*/



//Part D: Acceleration
//Every time the ball bounces, make it go faster.
//Add a new variable that keeps track of how many times the ball bounces
//Print that value to the console each frame

//Challenge  (+10%)
//Add a second ball
//Each ball should only move as long as neither ball has reached 25 bounces.
//When a ball hits 25 bounces, output a message to the console stating which colored ball "wins."
